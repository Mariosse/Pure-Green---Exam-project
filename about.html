    PICKWICK'S HISTORY
  </div>
  <div class="aboutsubtext2">
    Douwe Egberts has since 1753 gathered a lot of experience about 
    creating different tea blends. 1753 was the year that Egbert Douwe
    opened his first small shop in the Netherlands. Here he sold 
    coffee, tea and tobacco. Until April 1937, all tea was marketed 
    under the Douwe Egberts trademark. At that time, customers were 
    given a tea box on which was a drawing of an English mail van. 
    This packaging proved to be very popular and inspired to find an 
    English-sounding brand name for Douwe Egbert's tea. 
  <br>
  <br>
    The director of Douwe Egberts at the time had a wife who was as fond of
    tea as she was of Charles Dickens' books. Inspired by his short story 
    "Pickwick Papers", she suggested the name "Pickwick". Since then, 
    Douwe Egbert's tea has been marketed under this brand name.

   SUSTAINABILITY
</div>
<div class="aboutsubtext2">
  Tea is a global beverage. Millions of people around the world are 
  involved in the cultivation and production of tea. We therefore 
  believe that the tea industry bears a great ethical responsibility and
  through  Douwe Egbert's Master Blenders (DEMB)  we have committed ourselves 
  to sustainable purchase of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  We do this through our membership of The Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP). The membership 
  is in line with our efforts to contribute to long-term sustainability in the tea area and 
  it is also a logical step towards our ambition to constantly contribute to sustainable 
  business practices and compliance with high, ethical standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  ETP works to monitor the conditions for tea production worldwide to ensure that tea 
  plantations comply with the home countries' relevant laws and trade union agreements 
  regarding employment (including minimum age and wage level), education, maternity, etc. 
  ETP strives to work closely with tea producers and other stakeholders to promote an open 
  dialogue to ensure adequate living and working conditions for the workers in the tea 
  plantations and to strive for improvements where necessary. You can read more about ETP 
  and their work by clicking below.
